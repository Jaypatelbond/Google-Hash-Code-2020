### Submission in Python [version 1.0](https://github.com/Jaypatelbond/GoogleHashCode2020/blob/master/Submission%20in%20Python/Google_Hash_Code.py)
----
Simply this algorithm is about adding up the number of slices of the given Pizzas in reverse order

| Inputs | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| A_example | 16 Points |
| B_small | 99 Points |
| C – medium | 4,495 points |
| D – quite big | 999,999,725 points |
| E – also big | 504,999,983 points |
| Total | 1,505,004,318 |

### Submission in Python [Version 2.0](https://github.com/Jaypatelbond/GoogleHashCode2020/blob/master/Submission%20in%20Python/Google_Hash_Code_New.py)

The different solution found by us is 0/1 Knapsack Problem, Taking weights and capacity. Its a subset problem.

| Inputs | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| A_example | 16 Points |
| B_small | 100 Points |
| C – medium | 4,500 points |
| D – quite big | Computer Freezes |
| E – also big | Computer Freezes |
| Total | ------------ Points |

### Second Submission in Java

Heap problem for d_quite_big and e_also_big. I have generated the [GC_log](https://github.com/Jaypatelbond/GoogleHashCode2020/blob/master/Submission%20in%20Java/GoogleHashCode2020/gc.log) and attached the [heap dump](https://github.com/Jaypatelbond/GoogleHashCode2020/blob/master/Submission%20in%20Java/GoogleHashCode2020/java_pid5156.hprof) to understand the problem briefly in the **VisualVM**.

| Inputs | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| A_example | 16 Points |
| B_small | 100 Points |
| C – medium | 4,500 points |
| D – quite big | Out of Memory |
| E – also big | Out of Memory|
| Total | ------------- Points |
